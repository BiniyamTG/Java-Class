# Programming & Java Overview

## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of telling a computer what to do by writing instructions.  
A programming language allows humans to give these instructions to a computer.  

- Programming is mainly used to make machines perform tasks or to describe how a problem should be solved (algorithm).  
- Instructions are called **source code**, which is readable by humans. The computer translates it into **machine code** that the CPU can execute.

## Types of Programming Languages

| Type                          | Description                                                                 | Examples          |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Procedural**                | Step-by-step instructions, sequence matters (like a recipe)                 | C, Pascal        |
| **Functional**                | Focuses on functions, often uses recursion instead of loops                 | Haskell, Lisp    |
| **Object-Oriented (OOP)**     | Treats everything as objects with data and actions                          | Java, C++, Python|
| **Scripting**                 | Lightweight, for automating tasks or writing small programs                | JavaScript, PHP, Python |

### Key OOP Concepts

- **Encapsulation**: Object keeps its data and methods inside.  
- **Inheritance**: New objects can reuse features of old ones.  
- **Polymorphism**: One function can behave differently depending on the object.

## Java Overview

### What is Java?

- Java is **portable**: Write once, run anywhere (Windows, Mac, Linux).  
- Runs on **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** which translates Java code into machine code for any device.  
- Popular: 9–10 million developers, 13+ billion devices, 3rd most popular language.

**Example Analogy:** JVM is like a translator that allows your English letter to be understood anywhere in the world.

### Java Editions

| Edition | Use Case |
|---------|---------|
| Java SE | Core/general-purpose Java |
| Java EE | Enterprise & web applications |
| Java ME | Mobile & embedded devices |
| Java FX | GUI & multimedia applications |

### Java Design Goals

- **Safe**: Prevents memory corruption.  
- **Simple**: No low-level memory management needed.  
- **Portable**: Runs anywhere without modification.

### Java vs C++ Portability

| Feature           | Java                                                | C++                                                |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Compilation       | Compiled to bytecode, runs on JVM                  | Compiled to machine code, platform-specific    |
| Portability       | High, runs on any device with JVM                  | Low, must recompile for each platform          |
| Analogy           | English letter understood anywhere with translator | Local language letter needs rewriting elsewhere|

## Key Java Concepts

### Single vs Multiple Inheritance

- Java allows **single inheritance** for classes.  
- Supports **multiple inheritance** using **interfaces** (avoids diamond problem).

### Garbage Collection (GC)

- Java automatically manages memory for objects no longer in use.  
- Runs in the background inside JVM.  
- Can request GC manually using:


# Distributed Systems, Multithreading & Java Example

## Distributed Systems

- **Distributed** = work spread across multiple computers connected via a network.  
- Java provides tools for building distributed systems: **RMI, sockets, web services**.

---

## Multithreading

- A **thread** is a small, independent unit of execution.  
- **Multithreading** allows running multiple threads at the same time inside a program.

## Java Program Execution Steps

1. Write code → `.java` file  
2. Compile → bytecode `.class`  
3. JVM loads & verifies bytecode  
4. JVM executes code → output appears  
5. JVM performs garbage collection in the background

---

## Java Example: Employee Info

```java
// Class name should not have spaces
public class EmpInfo {

    // Fields / attributes
    String name;
    String age;
    String salary;

    // Constructor to initialize values
    public EmpInfo(String name, String age, String salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // Method to display info
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
    }

    // Main method
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of EmpInfo
        EmpInfo emp = new EmpInfo("Messi", "25", "5000");

        // Print employee info
        emp.displayInfo();
    }
}

``` 



# Java Basics Notes

---

## 1. Portability and Security in Java

- **Bytecode is executed by JVM** → makes Java **portable** and **secure**.
- Other features:  
  - Applets: used for security (obsolete)  
  - Exception handling: improves reliability, not security/portability  
  - Dynamic binding: supports polymorphism, not security/portability  

---

## 2. Debugging Java Programs

- **JDB (Java Debugger)** → used to **find and fix bugs**.
- Other tools:  
  - JVM → executes bytecode  
  - JRE → runs Java programs  
  - JDK → complete development kit, includes JDB  

---

## 3. Java Features

- **Dynamic** → supports runtime method dispatch  
- **Architecture Neutral** → bytecode runs on any platform with JVM  
- **Object-oriented** → classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
- **Not allowed:** use of pointers  

---

## 4. Java File Extensions

- **.java** → Java source code file  
- **.class** → compiled bytecode  
- **.js** → JavaScript file (not Java)  
- **.txt** → plain text file  

---

## 5. JAR File

- **JAR** → Java Archive (bundles classes and resources)  
- **Not**: Java Archive Runner / Java Application Resource / Java Application Runner  

---

## 6. Environment Variables

- **JAVA_HOME** → sets path to JDK installation  
- **CLASSPATH** → path for Java classes  
- **MAVEN_HOME** → Maven path  
- **JAVA** → not standard  

---

## 7. Java Compilation, Debugging, Execution

- **JDK** → includes compiler (`javac`), debugger (`jdb`), and JRE/JVM  
- **JRE** → runs Java programs  
- **JVM** → executes bytecode  
- **JIT** → optimizes bytecode at runtime  

---

## 8. Printing in Java (Cheat Code)

```java
System.out.println("Hello"); // with newline
System.out.print("Hello");   // without newline
// Eclipse shortcut: type 'syso' + Ctrl+Space → expands to System.out.println();
